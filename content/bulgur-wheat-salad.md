- üç≥ Cook time: 45 min
- üçΩÔ∏è Servings: 4 as a main

## Ingredients


- 2 large aubergines (500g net weight), cut into 3cm chunks
- 100ml olive oil
- Salt and black pepper
- 2 onions, peeled and finely sliced
- 3 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed
- 1 tsp ground allspice
- 400g cherry tomatoes
- 1 tbsp tomato paste
- 250g bulgur wheat
- 200g Greek-style yoghurt
- 1 small preserved lemon, pips discarded, skin and flesh finely chopped
- 10g mint leaves (about 1 tbsp) finely shredded


## Directions


1. Heat the oven to 220C/425F/gas 7. 
2. Put the aubergine in a large bowl with four tablespoons of oil, half a teaspoon of salt and a good grind of pepper. 
3. Mix, then spread out on a large oven tray lined with greaseproof paper and roast for 30-35 minutes, stirring once halfway, until the aubergines are caramelised and soft. Take out of the oven and leave to cool.
4. Meanwhile, put three tablespoons of oil in a large saute pan for which you have a lid and heat on a medium-high flame. 
5. Once hot, fry the onion for eight minutes, stirring a few times, until caramelised and soft. 
6. Add the garlic and allspice, fry for a minute, stirring continuously, until the garlic is aromatic and starting to brown, then add the cherry tomatoes, mashing them with a potato masher to break them up. 
7. Stir in the tomato paste, 400ml water and a teaspoon of salt, bring to a boil, turn down the heat to medium-low, cover and cook for 12 minutes. 
8. Add the bulgur, stirring it in so it‚Äôs completely coated, then turn off the heat and set aside for 20 minutes, so the bulgur can absorb all the liquid.
9. In a medium bowl, mix the yoghurt with the preserved lemon, half the mint and an eighth of a teaspoon of salt.
10. Divide the bulgur between four plates and serve with the yoghurt and aubergine alongside and a sprinkling of the remaining mint.
